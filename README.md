# Ads API

A small Go HTTP API around a single domain: *ads* (classified ads).

The API needs an up-and-running postgres database, which can be launched via the provided Docker Compose file.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or later
- Docker with the Compose plugin

## Launching the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL with the schema and seed data already applied, as well as the `ads` api.

## Model

There are 2 entities in this sample:
- ad (title, price, etc...)
- user (id and nickname only)

## API

| Method | Path          | Auth | Description                                                                       |
|--------|---------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `POST` | `/ads`        | yes | Create an ad                                                                      |
| `GET` | `/ads/{id}`   | no | Get a single ad                                                                   |
| `GET` | `/ads`        | no | List ads (filterable by `title`, `user_id`, `min_price_cents`, `max_price_cents`) |
| `POST` | `/ads/import` | yes | Bulk ad import                                                                    |

```bash
# Health check
curl -s -v http://localhost:8080/health

# List ads (with optional filters)
curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/ads?title=bike&min_price_cents=1000'

# Get a single ad
curl -s http://localhost:8080/ads/1

# Create an ad (requires Authorization header)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/ads \
  -H 'Authorization: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"Mountain bike","price_cents":12000,"photo_url":"https://example.com/photos/bike.jpg"}'
```

## Authentication

To pass authentication information to a call, simply add the `Authorization` header with the user ID in plain text.

It will be extracted by the service.

```
Authorization: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
```

## Tests

To launch all the tests:

```shell
go test ./...
```
